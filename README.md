# REAL Connections Website

# Getting Started
Open up `index.html` in a web browser. Everything should work out of the gate. A few resources for the calendar and the gallery are sourced from CDNs (or various Google accounts), so make sure you have an Internet connection.

To change which Google Calendar displays on the site, tweak the parameters in the `<script>` tags at the bottom of calendar.html. The calendar was implemented using [FullCalendar](http://fullcalendar.io/).

To change which account populates the gallery, tweak the parameters in the div with id `plusgallery` in gallery.html. The gallery was implemented using [PlusGallery](http://www.plusgallery.net/).

The site's code is (for now, at least) hosted at [github.com/mculhane/Realconnections](github.com/mculhane/Realconnections). GitHub is the best place to go for the most updated version of the code.
